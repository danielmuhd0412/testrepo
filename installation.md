# Installation instructions git

Hi! This ist the instruction for installing **Git** on your pc. We show you how to install it on Windows, Linux and Mac - but we’ll use only Windows in this workshop.

# For Windows users

Open the [Git download page](https://git-scm.com/download/win). The page should automatically detect your system architecture and start the download. Just save the file.

> If your download doesn’t start automatically, choose from the 32-bit and 64-bit executable installer.

Open the executable and hit `Next`. Select the installing location (we recommend to leave it at default) and on the next page choose your installing preferences (e.g. if you want a desktop shortcut or a windows explorer integration). Hit `Next` and decide if you want a start menu folder.  
On the next pages, we recommend to leave all settings at default. Just hit `Next` and on the last page hit `Install`. The setup will now install git to your pc. Click `Finish` to close the installer.

# For Linux users

Open the [Git download page](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) for instructions.  
Depending on your linux distribution, you have to use the right command for installing git.  
e.g. for Ubuntu/Debian it’s: _**sudo apt-get install git**_

Open the terminal on your pc and type in the command for your distribution and hit return on your keyboard.

> Note: It may be required to type in your root password - you’ll see on the terminal

# For Mac users

Open the [Git download page](http://git-scm.com/download/mac) for instructions.

We recommend to use the _**Binary installer**_ \- if you have proper knowledge, how to install software on mac, you can choose another way. The binary installer isn’t the latest release, but it’s a quite recent version. You can find it on [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/) .

After downloading the installer, execute it and follow the installation steps to install it on your mac.
